# simple-Salesman
A traveling salesman algorithm that follows the path with the least cost, but stays close to the perimeter of the network.
After the perimeter is traversed, go back and traverse all unvisited nodes which should be in the interior of the network.

This was based on the assumption that a route following the perimeter of the network would result in a good approximation
of a near optimal route.
